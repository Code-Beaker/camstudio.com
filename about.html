        <p>
          CamStudio is able to record all screen and audio activity on your
          computer and create industry-standard AVI video files and using its
          built-in SWF Producer can turn those AVIs into lean, mean,
          bandwidth-friendly Streaming Flash videos (SWFs)
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="container">
        Here are just a few ways you can use this software:
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can use it to create demonstration videos for any software
            program.
          </li>
          <li>
            Or how about creating a set of videos answering your most frequently
            asked questions?
          </li>
          <li>
            You can use it to Create video tutorials for school or college
            classes.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can use it to Create video-beased information products you can
            sell.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can even use it to record new tricks and techniques you discover
            on your favourite software program, before you forget them.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="container">
        <h1 class="heading">Some Other features</h1>
        <h3 class="subheading">Change the tone of your voice.</h3>
        <p class="feature">
          CamStudio can also add high-quality, anti-aliased (no jagged edges)
          screen captions to your recordings in seconds and with the unique
          Video Annotation feature you can even personalise your videos by
          including a webcam movie of yourself "picture-in-picture" over your
          desktop.
        </p>
        <p class="feature">
          And if all that wasn't enough, CamStudio also comes with its own
          Lossless Codec that produces crystal clear results with a much smaller
          filesize compared with other more popular codecs, like Microsoft Video
          1.
        </p>
        <p class="feature">
          You have total control over the output of your video: you can choose
          to use custom cursors, to record the whole screen or just a section of
          it and can reduce or increase the quality of the recording depending
          on if you want smaller videos (for emailing to people, for instance)
          or you can have "best quality" ones for burning onto CD/DVD.
